## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

All features follow a consistent pattern:

```
MenuSystem (Main Controller)
    ├── TimeTravelController
    ├── VirtualMirrorController
    ├── BiomeController
    ├── VideoGameWorldController
    └── CustomPromptController
            ↓
    WebRTCConnection (AI Communication)
            ↓
    Decart AI Service
```

### Code Structure

Each feature controller implements:
- `Activate()` - Called when feature is selected
- `Deactivate()` - Called when returning to menu
- `Update()` - Handles joystick input
- `ApplyTransformation()` - Sends prompt to AI

### AI Prompt Engineering

All prompts are carefully crafted following Decart AI best practices:
- Detailed descriptions (20-30 words)
- Material and texture specifications
- Lighting and atmosphere details
- Style-specific keywords
- Temporal consistency considerations

---

## Performance Considerations

### Network Requirements
- **Minimum**: 8 Mbps bidirectional
- **Recommended**: 5GHz WiFi with strong signal
- **Latency**: ~150-200ms end-to-end processing

### Processing Time
- Initial connection: 3-5 seconds
- Transformation application: 2-3 seconds
- Prompt changes: Instant switching

### Battery Life
- Approximately 2 hours continuous use
- Varies based on network conditions
- AI processing is remote (doesn't drain Quest CPU)

## Customization Guide

### Adding Your Own Prompts

#### Time Travel Eras
Edit `TimeTravelController.cs`, add to `eras` array:
```csharp
new Era { 
    startYear = 2150, 
    endYear = 2200, 
    name = "My Era",
    description = "My description",
    aiPrompt = "Transform into..."
}
```

#### Virtual Mirror Clothing
Edit `VirtualMirrorController.cs`, add in `InitializeClothingOptions()`:
```csharp
AddClothingOption(
    "My Outfit",
    "Short description",
    "Change the outfit to [detailed prompt]"
);
```

#### Biomes
Edit `BiomeController.cs`, add in `InitializeBiomeOptions()`:
```csharp
AddBiomeOption(
    "My Biome",
    "Short description",
    "Transform into [detailed environment description]"
);
```

#### Game Worlds
Edit `VideoGameWorldController.cs`, add in `InitializeGameWorldOptions()`:
```csharp
AddGameWorldOption(
    "My Game",
    "Short description",
    "Transform into [game aesthetic description]"
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Feature Not Activating
- Ensure WebRTCConnection is properly referenced in Inspector
- Check console for error messages
- Verify internet connection is active

### Transformation Not Applying
- Wait 3-5 seconds for initial AI processing
- Check network connection (8+ Mbps required)
- Try simpler prompts first
- Restart the app if transformations stop working

### Menu Navigation Issues
- Verify OVR Input is detecting controllers
- Check controller batteries
- Ensure joystick deadzone settings are appropriate

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Save/load favorite transformations
- Voice-to-text for custom prompts (currently only keyboard)
- Preset collections (e.g., "Movie Themes", "Art History")
- Multi-user transformations
