Lucy Edit ComfyUI Cookbook: Text-Guided Video Editing

​
Lucy Edit transforms videos with text prompts while preserving motion
Lucy Edit is a video editing model that performs instruction-guided edits on videos using free-text prompts. The model supports clothing changes, character replacements, object insertions, and scene transformations while preserving the original motion and composition perfectly. This cookbook shows you how to set up and use Lucy Edit in ComfyUI for professional video editing results.
​
What Lucy Edit does best
Motion preservation keeps videos smooth. Lucy Edit maintains the original motion and composition of your videos perfectly, allowing precise edits without disrupting the flow.
Edit reliability improves over other methods. Compared to common inference time methods, Lucy Edit produces more robust and consistent edits.
Identity conservation maintains character features. When changing clothing or accessories, the model preserves the subject’s identity and facial features.
No masks or finetuning needed. Pure text instructions drive all edits—you don’t need to create masks or finetune models for common editing tasks.
​
Installation takes three steps
​
Step 1: Clone the repository into ComfyUI
Navigate to your ComfyUI’s custom_nodes folder and clone the Lucy Edit repository:
Copy
Ask AI
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/DecartAI/lucy-edit-comfyui.git

​
Step 2: Install Python dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
Copy
Ask AI
cd lucy-edit-comfyui
pip install -r requirements.txt

​
Step 3: Download model weights
Choose the right weights for your system. Download either FP16 (smaller, faster) or FP32 (full precision) weights based on your hardware capabilities:
FP16 weights (recommended for most users): https://huggingface.co/decart-ai/Lucy-Edit-Dev-ComfyUI/resolve/main/lucy-edit-dev-cui-fp16.safetensors
FP32 weights (for maximum precision): https://huggingface.co/decart-ai/Lucy-Edit-Dev-ComfyUI/resolve/main/lucy-edit-dev-cui.safetensors
Place the downloaded weights in: ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/
​
Two ways to run Lucy Edit
​
Option 1: Lucy Edit Pro uses the API for faster processing
API processing offloads computation. Lucy Edit Pro runs on Decart’s servers, requiring no local GPU resources.
Load the workflow from examples/basic-api-lucy-edit.json
Get an API key from https://platform.decart.ai/
Enter your API key in the workflow node
Upload your video and enter your edit prompt
Run the workflow to process your edit
​
Option 2: Lucy Edit Dev runs entirely on your machine
Local processing gives you full control. Lucy Edit Dev runs on your hardware, ideal for sensitive content or offline work.
Load the workflow from examples/basic-lucy-edit-dev.json
Ensure model weights are in the correct folder
Upload your video and enter your edit prompt
Run the workflow to process locally
System requirements for local processing:
GPU with at least 16GB VRAM (24GB recommended)
32GB system RAM minimum
CUDA-compatible graphics card
​
Six types of edits you can make
​
1. Clothing changes work best
Lucy Edit excels at wardrobe swaps. The model performs clothing changes with the highest accuracy and consistency.
Write clothing prompts with specific details:
✅ “Change the shirt to a silk kimono with wide sleeves and cherry blossom patterns”
❌ “Change clothes”
Include material, fit, and style details for best results. Describe textures (silk, leather, denim), patterns (stripes, florals), and fit (loose, tight, flowing).
​
2. Character replacements transform subjects reliably
Replace humans with creatures or characters. This edit type works well for transforming people into animals, monsters, or fictional characters.
Effective character replacement prompts:
✅ “Replace the person with a Bengal tiger, striped orange fur, muscular build, alert ears”
✅ “Replace the woman with an anime character, large expressive eyes, blue hair, school uniform”
❌ “Make them a tiger”
Describe physical characteristics, textures, and distinctive features. Avoid pronouns like “him” or “her”—use “person,” “man,” or “woman” instead.
​
3. Object replacements maintain structure
Swap objects while preserving size and position. Object replacement works best when the new object has similar dimensions to the original.
Structure-preserving object swaps:
✅ “Replace the apple with a crystal ball, clear glass, internal light refractions, palm-sized”
✅ “Replace the coffee cup with a medieval goblet, pewter metal, ornate engravings”
❌ “Change the apple”
Keep replacement objects plausible in scale and context. A handheld item should replace another handheld item.
​
4. Color changes need precise descriptions
Color edits show mixed reliability. Some color changes are subtle, others dramatic. Detailed descriptions improve consistency.
Color change prompts that work:
✅ “Change the jacket color to deep burgundy leather with matte finish”
✅ “Change the car paint to metallic silver with mirror-like reflections”
❌ “Make it red”
Specify the exact shade, material properties, and finish (matte, glossy, metallic).
​
5. Adding objects works for wearables and props
Added items often attach to subjects. This edit type works best for accessories, handheld items, or wearable objects.
Successful object additions:
✅ “Add aviator sunglasses on the person’s face, gold frames, reflective lenses”
✅ “Add a leather backpack on the person’s shoulders, brown, worn texture”
⚠️ “Add a floating balloon” (may attach to person instead of floating)
Specify exactly where the object should appear and how it connects to the scene.
​
6. Global transformations change entire scenes
Scene-wide changes may alter subjects. Transform backgrounds, lighting, or artistic style—but be aware this can affect character identity.
Global transformation examples:
✅ “Transform the sunny beach into a snowy winter scene, falling snowflakes, overcast sky”
✅ “Transform to 2D cartoon style, bold outlines, flat colors, cel-shaded appearance”
⚠️ May change subject appearance along with the scene
Use global transformations when you want comprehensive scene changes. For preserving subjects while changing backgrounds, combine with specific preservation instructions.
​
Write prompts that get better results
​
Start every prompt with the right trigger word
Trigger words tell the model your intent. Beginning with the correct trigger word improves edit accuracy:
“Change” → Clothing or color modifications
“Add” → Adding accessories or objects
“Replace” → Subject or object substitution
“Transform” → Global scene or style changes
​
Include 20-30 descriptive words for best results
Details improve edit precision. Short prompts like “change shirt to red” produce generic results. Rich descriptions yield professional edits.
Compare these prompts:
Basic: “Change shirt to kimono”
Better: “Change the shirt to a silk kimono with deep indigo dye, wide flowing sleeves, subtle crane pattern embroidery, loose fit, soft drape, natural folds”
​
Describe materials, textures, and visual properties
Concrete visual details guide the model. Include:
Materials (silk, leather, cotton, metal)
Textures (fuzzy, smooth, rough, glossy)
Patterns (stripes, florals, geometric)
Lighting (soft, harsh, dramatic)
Scale and positioning
Colors with modifiers (deep, pale, vibrant)
​
Avoid these common prompt mistakes
Don’t mention what to preserve. The model already preserves motion and pose—mentioning it can confuse the edit.
❌ “Change the shirt to red while preserving the pose”
✅ “Change the shirt to bright red cotton with ribbed texture”
Don’t use personal pronouns. Replace “me,” “him,” “her” with specific descriptors.
❌ “Replace me with a robot”
✅ “Replace the person with a chrome robot”
Don’t reference specific people. Avoid mentioning hair color or identifying features.
❌ “Change the blonde woman’s dress”
✅ “Change the dress to emerald green silk”
​
Troubleshooting common issues
​
Edit not applying strongly enough
Increase prompt detail. Add more descriptive words about materials, textures, and visual properties. Consider adjusting the guidance scale in your ComfyUI workflow.
​
Motion becoming unstable
Use 81-frame generations. Longer clips (81 frames) produce better temporal consistency than shorter ones. Ensure your input video is properly formatted and stable.
​
Character identity changing unexpectedly
Avoid global transformations for identity preservation. Use targeted edits (clothing, accessories) instead of scene-wide transforms. Add identity-preserving keywords if needed.
​
Processing taking too long
Optimize your settings:
Use FP16 weights instead of FP32
Reduce resolution if quality allows
Consider using the API version for faster processing
Process shorter clips when testing prompts
​
Examples showcase the possibilities
​
Professional outfit changes
Input: Woman in casual wear Prompt: “Change the outfit to a tailored business suit, charcoal gray wool, slim fit blazer, matching pencil skirt, white silk blouse underneath, pearl buttons” Result: Professional transformation while maintaining identity and pose
​
Creative character replacements
Input: Person walking Prompt: “Replace the person with a steampunk robot, brass gears visible, copper plating, steam vents on shoulders, glowing blue eyes, mechanical joints” Result: Robotic character maintaining original walking motion
​
Seasonal scene transformations
Input: Summer park scene Prompt: “Transform the scene to autumn, golden hour lighting, orange and red maple leaves falling, warm amber tones, soft shadows, crisp atmosphere” Result: Complete seasonal change with consistent motion
