Realtime
Overview
Copy page
Transform and edit live video streams in realtime with AI. Our realtime video models enable both creative style transformations and precise video editing with minimal latency.
Choose between style transformation (Mirage) for artistic effects or video editing (Lucy) for adding, changing, or removing elements in your video streams.
​
Available Models
We offer two specialized realtime video models, each optimized for different use cases:
Model	Use Case	Example Prompts	Best For
Mirage	Style transformation	”Anime style”, “Cyberpunk city”, “Studio Ghibli animation”	Creative effects, artistic filters, visual themes
Lucy	Video editing	”Add a dog”, “Change hair to blonde”, “Remove the car”	Object manipulation, scene editing, precise modifications
​
Mirage - Video Restyling
Transform the overall visual style and aesthetic of your video stream. Perfect for creative applications, social media filters, and artistic effects.
