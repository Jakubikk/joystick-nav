## Configuring the Unity Project

### Step 1: Load the Main Scene

1. In the Project window, navigate to:
   `Assets/Samples/DecartAI-Quest/`
2. Double-click `DecartAI-Main.unity`
3. The scene will load in the Hierarchy and Scene views

### Step 2: Configure Player Settings

1. Click **Edit** → **Project Settings**
2. Select **Player** from the left sidebar

#### Android Settings:

1. **Company Name:** Enter your name or company
2. **Product Name:** "Decart Quest AI" (or your preferred name)

3. Under **Other Settings:**
   - **Package Name:** com.YourCompany.DecartQuestAI
     - Replace YourCompany with your organization name (no spaces, lowercase)
   - **Minimum API Level:** Android 10.0 (API Level 29)
   - **Target API Level:** Android 14.0 (API Level 34) or higher
   - **Scripting Backend:** IL2CPP
   - **Api Compatibility Level:** .NET Standard 2.1
   - **Target Architectures:** Check ARM64 ✅ (uncheck ARMv7)

4. Under **Rendering:**
   - **Graphics APIs:** Should show "Vulkan" or "OpenGLES3"
     - If you see "Vulkan" with "OpenGLES3" below it, that's fine
     - To modify: Click the ➕ or ➖ buttons, but default is usually correct
   - **Color Space:** Linear
   - **Auto Graphics API:** Can be checked or unchecked (default is fine)

5. Under **Configuration:**
   - Scroll to find **Scripting Define Symbols**
   - Make sure there are no conflicting symbols

### Step 3: Configure XR Plugin Management

1. Still in Project Settings, select **XR Plug-in Management** from left sidebar
2. Click on the **Android tab** (Android icon)
3. Check ✅ **Oculus**

4. Click the **>** arrow next to Oculus to expand settings:
   - **Stereo Rendering Mode:** Multiview (default)
   - ❌ **Low Overhead Mode (GLES):** Must be UNCHECKED
   - ❌ **Meta Quest: Occlusion:** Must be UNCHECKED
   - (Other settings can remain default)

### Step 4: Install Required Packages

1. Click **Window** → **Package Manager**
2. In Package Manager window, change dropdown from "Packages: In Project" to "Packages: Unity Registry"

3. Search for and install these packages if not already installed:
   - **Input System** - Find it, click "Install"
   - **TextMeshPro** - Should be pre-installed
   - **Universal Render Pipeline** - Should be pre-installed

4. Close Package Manager when done

### Step 5: Fix Meta XR Configuration Issues

1. Click **Edit** → **Project Settings**
2. Select **Meta XR** from the left sidebar (you may need to scroll)
3. You'll see two sections:
   - **Outstanding Issues**
   - **Recommended Items**

4. **Outstanding Issues Section:**
   - Fix all issues EXCEPT these two (leave these unfixed):
     - "Hand Tracking must be enabled in OVRManager when using its Building Block"
     - "When Using Passthrough Building Block as an underlay it's required to set the camera background to transparent"
   - For other issues, click "Fix" or "Fix All"

5. **Recommended Items Section:**
   - Fix all recommendations EXCEPT these (leave these unfixed):
     - "Use Low Overhead Mode"
     - "Hand tracking support is set to 'Controllers Only', hand tracking will not work in this mode"
   - For other items, click "Apply" or "Apply All"

### Step 6: Configure Scene Objects (Unity Scene Setup)

Since the new menu system requires UI setup, we need to add the UI elements to the scene. However, since this is a Unity scene file (.unity), I'll provide you with the configuration steps:

1. **Create Menu Canvas:**
   - Right-click in Hierarchy → UI → Canvas
   - Name it "MainMenuCanvas"
   - In Inspector, set:
     - Render Mode: World Space
     - Position: (0, 1.5, 2) - in front of user at eye level
     - Rotation: (0, 0, 0)
     - Scale: (0.001, 0.001, 0.001)
     - Width: 1920
     - Height: 1080

2. **Add Menu Manager:**
   - Select the main camera or create an empty GameObject called "MenuSystem"
   - Click "Add Component"
   - Search for "MenuManager"
   - Select it to add

*Note: Full UI setup is complex and typically done in Unity Editor. For simplicity, you can test the scripts first and add UI elements as needed. The scripts are ready and will work once proper UI is created in Unity Editor.*

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Decart API Integration:

If you want to use your own Decart API key:

1. Get API key from https://platform.decart.ai/
2. In Unity, find the WebRTCConnection script
3. Update the WebSocket URLs to include your API key:
   ```
   wss://api3.decart.ai/v1/stream?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&model=mirage
   ```

### Modifying Features:

All feature scripts are in:
`Assets/Samples/DecartAI-Quest/Scripts/Features/`

To modify prompts or add new options:
1. Open the relevant feature script
2. Find the list of prompts (usually near the top)
3. Add or modify entries in the list
4. Save and rebuild

### Creating New Features:

1. Create a new C# script in `Scripts/Features/`
2. Inherit from `MonoBehaviour`
3. Add reference to `WebRTCConnection`
4. Implement your feature logic
5. Add to MenuManager's feature list
6. Rebuild and test

### Performance Tuning:

In `WebRTCConnection.cs`, you can adjust:
- `VideoResolution` - Lower resolution = better performance
- `maxFramerate` - Lower FPS = lower bandwidth
- `maxBitrate` / `minBitrate` - Quality vs speed tradeoff

---

## Automation Scripts
