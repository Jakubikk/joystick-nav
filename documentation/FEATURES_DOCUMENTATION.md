## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The new feature system is built on top of the existing DecartXR foundation:

1. **MenuManager.cs** - Handles main menu navigation and state management
2. **FeatureIntegrationController.cs** - Coordinates all feature controllers with WebRTC
3. **Individual Feature Controllers** - Each feature has its own controller
4. **WebRTCConnection** - Existing component for Decart AI communication

### Integration with Decart AI

All features use the existing Decart AI models:
- **Mirage Model**: For environment/world transformations (Time Travel, Biome, Game Styles)
- **Lucy Model**: For person transformations (Virtual Dressing Room)
- **Custom Prompts**: Routed through the same WebRTC connection

### Prompt Engineering

Each feature includes carefully crafted prompts designed to:
- Provide detailed visual descriptions
- Include relevant textures, materials, and atmosphere
- Maintain temporal consistency
- Work effectively with Decart's AI models

## File Structure

```

```

## Setup Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Add Controllers to Scene**:
   - Create empty GameObjects for each controller
   - Add the corresponding script component
   - Assign UI references in the Inspector

2. **Create UI Panels**:
   - Create Canvas UI panels for each feature
   - Add TextMeshPro components for labels
   - Add Slider component for Time Travel
   - Add InputField component for Custom Input

3. **Wire Up References**:
   - Assign UI elements to controller public fields
   - Link WebRTCConnection reference
   - Configure colors and settings

4. **Build and Deploy**:
   - Follow the complete beginner guide in `documentation/COMPLETE_BEGINNER_GUIDE.md`
   - Build for Android/Quest 3
   - Deploy via SideQuest or ADB

### UI Design Guidelines

For best VR experience:
- Use large, readable fonts (32pt+)
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Minimum button size: 100x100 pixels
- Space elements for VR pointer precision
- Use world-space canvas for 3D positioning

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

1. **Prompt Sending**:
   - Cooldown timers prevent flooding the AI service
   - Prompts are queued to avoid conflicts
   - Only send when values actually change

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Controllers are lightweight
   - No heavy asset loading
   - Minimal overhead on existing system

3. **Network Usage**:
   - Prompts are text-based (minimal bandwidth)
   - AI processing happens server-side
   - Video stream is handled by existing WebRTC

## Customization

### Adding New Options

To add new clothing, biomes, or game styles:

1. Open the relevant controller file
2. Find the `InitializeOptions()` method
3. Add new options to the list:

```csharp
new ClothingOption 
{ 
    name = "Your Option Name", 
    prompt = "Detailed description for AI transformation..."
}
```

### Modifying Time Periods

Edit `GenerateTimeTravelPrompt()` in `TimeTravelController.cs`:

```csharp
else if (year < YOUR_YEAR)
{
    return "Your detailed time period prompt...";
}
```

### Changing Navigation Colors

Update in Inspector or modify defaults:
```csharp
[SerializeField] private Color normalColor = new Color(1f, 1f, 1f, 0.8f);
[SerializeField] private Color selectedColor = new Color(0f, 1f, 1f, 1f);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Menu not responding to joystick**:
- Check OVRInput is properly configured
- Verify controllers are paired
- Check for conflicting input handlers

**Prompts not transforming view**:
- Verify WebRTC connection is established
- Check internet connection (8+ Mbps)
- Wait full 3-5 seconds for processing
- Check Decart AI service status

**Custom keyboard not appearing**:
- Ensure TMP_InputField is assigned
- Check Quest keyboard settings
- Verify input field is set to activate

**Transformations look incorrect**:
- Ensure good lighting
- Try more detailed prompts
- Check camera positioning
- Verify stable internet connection

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Saved favorites for quick access
- History of recent transformations
- Preset combinations
- Social sharing features
- More granular controls
- Animation transitions between states
